##KeenKoalas - R Script Draft

##This script is made up of the following sections:
## - Set working directory and Call the "Data_Cleaning.R" script (from the data cleaning portion of the project) to import the data for this project and do basic initial data setup.
## - Make preparations for analysis by creating subsets of the data with various conditions and printing the basic statistics for the relevant variables in the subsets. 
## - Create further subsets for use in research on possible differences in pesticide residues by variety, state, and grade labeling. Basic statistics for relevant variables in the new subsets are printed where appropriate.
## - Create data frames with the frequency and average concentrations of pesticides for research on residue related changes between 2004 and 2014, as well as differences between conventional versus organic samples. Basic statistics for relevant variables in the new subsets are printed for the final resulting data frames.
